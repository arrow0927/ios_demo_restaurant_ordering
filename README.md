2011 - ios_demo_restaurant_ordering
============================

This is just the front end iOS part where a user can see all the location of the chain "Burrito Boyz" in Waterloo, ON. 

This started as a project becuase I loved the burritos from this chain but it was often too cold to walk to the store and then wait in lin
to order the custom burrito. I wanted to devise a solution where I could send my order to the store, they would receive the order and 
by the time i got to the store the order would be ready.

So this app shows you the locations near you onnthe map.
You can then pick a location and send the order to tha location
